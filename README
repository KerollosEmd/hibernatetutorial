# Hibernate Tutorial Project

This project serves as a comprehensive tutorial for understanding and implementing Hibernate, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java.

## Overview

Hibernate simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables and vice-versa. This project demonstrates various core concepts of Hibernate, including:

* **Basic CRUD Operations:** Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data using Hibernate.
* **Mapping Strategies:** Different ways to map Java classes to database tables (e.g., annotations, XML).
* **Relationships:** Handling one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
* **Inheritance Mapping:** Strategies for mapping inheritance hierarchies.
* **Caching:** Understanding and implementing Hibernate's caching mechanisms.
* **Querying:** Using HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and Criteria API.
* **Transactions:** Managing database transactions with Hibernate.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** Programming Language
* **Maven:** Build Automation Tool
* **Hibernate:** ORM Framework
* **PostgreSQL:** Relational Database (can be easily configured for other databases)
* **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Standard API for persistence in Java

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific Hibernate concept.

* `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code, including entity classes, DAO (Data Access Object) implementations, and utility classes.
* `src/main/resources`: Contains configuration files such as `hibernate.cfg.xml` and `log4j.properties`.
* `pom.xml`: Maven project object model file, defining dependencies and build configurations.
